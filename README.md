# Board Class Documentation

The `Board` class represents a chess board and is used to handle the state of the board. It utilizes an 8x8 matrix to represent the positions of the chess pieces on the board.

### Class Attributes:

- `fen`: A string representing the FEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation) notation of the current state of the chess board.
- `board`: A 2-dimensional list representing the 8x8 matrix of the chess board.
- `turn`: A string representing the current turn, either 'w' for white or 'b' for black.
- `letToNum`: A dictionary mapping chess notation letters (a-h) to column numbers (1-8).
- `numToLet`: A dictionary mapping column numbers (1-8) to chess notation letters (a-h).

### Class Methods:

- `__init__(self, fen="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1")`: Initializes a `Board` object with the given FEN notation or the default starting position.
- `initialize(self)`: Resets the board to the starting position.
- `print_board(self)`: Prints the current state of the chess board in a fancy format.
- `get_board(self)`: Returns the current state of the chess board as a 2-dimensional list.
- `get_turn(self)`: Returns the current turn, either 'w' for white or 'b' for black.
- `get_piece(self, index)`: Returns the chess piece object at the given chessDex (e.g., "e4").
- `make_move(self, move)`: Makes a move on the chess board based on the given chessDex move (e.g., "e2e4").
- `is_valid_move(self, col, row, selfColor)`: Checks if a square can be moved to based on the given column, row, and selfColor (current player color).
- `isEmptyColRow(self, col, row)`: Checks if a square at the given column and row is empty.
- `xyToChess(self, col, row)`: Converts the column and row coordinates to chessDex notation (e.g., "e4").
- `chessToMatrix(self, chessDex)`: Converts the chessDex notation (e.g., "e4") to matrix index coordinates.
- `is_enemy_piece(self, col, row, color)`: Checks if there is an enemy piece at the given column and row coordinates.

### Helper Functions:

- `fen_to_matrix(fen)`: Converts the FEN notation to an 8x8 matrix representing the chess board.
- `indexToMatrix(col, row)`: Converts the column and row coordinates to matrix index coordinates.

ChessPiece Class Documentation
The ChessPiece class is a superclass for all chess pieces. It represents a generic chess piece and provides a common attribute for all pieces, which is the color of the piece.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the chess piece ("w" for white or "b" for black).
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a ChessPiece object with the given color.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the chess piece. This method is overridden in the subclasses.
Pawn Class Documentation
The Pawn class represents a pawn chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass and adds an additional attribute for en passant moves.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the pawn ("w" for white or "b" for black).
rowDict: A dictionary mapping row numbers to chess notation letters for pawn promotion.
en_passant_possible: A boolean indicating if the pawn can be captured en passant.
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a Pawn object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the pawn on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the pawn.
Rook Class Documentation
The Rook class represents a rook chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the rook ("w" for white or "b" for black).
can_castle: A boolean indicating if the rook can participate in castling.
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a Rook object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the rook on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the rook.
Knight Class Documentation
The Knight class represents a knight chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the knight ("w" for white or "b" for black).
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a Knight object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the knight on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the knight.
Bishop Class Documentation
The Bishop class represents a bishop chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the bishop ("w" for white or "b" for black).
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a Bishop object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the bishop on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the bishop.
Queen Class Documentation
The Queen class represents a queen chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the queen ("w" for white or "b" for black).
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a Queen object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the queen on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the queen.
King Class Documentation
The King class represents a king chess piece. It inherits from the ChessPiece superclass.

Class Attributes:
color: A string representing the color of the king ("w" for white or "b" for black).
can_castle: A boolean indicating if the king can participate in castling.
Class Methods:
__init__(self, color): Initializes a King object with the given color.
valid_moves(self, board, col, row): Returns a list of valid moves for the king on the chess board.
__str__(self): Returns a string representation of the king.
